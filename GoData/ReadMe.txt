This is very much a WIP and an attempt at a dataframe implementation in Go. Implementation is not optimized and heavily inspired by Gota. This mainly served as a way to learn Go in a fun way.
Data is fictitious and generated for test purposes. I cheated a little and used a LLM a bit :) 

Next steps: 

Windowed Functions
Read from database
Parquet file support
More optimized method implementations

And More!
