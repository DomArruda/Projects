I've included a Physics Dataset if you'd like to see whether the algorithm can learn the physics equation of d = xo + vo*t + 1/at^2     :)

This can be used for any other dataset too, but only works for regression at this time. Since the algorithm slows down when using many variables and large datasets, consider getting feature importance scores before running the Symbolic Regression.
