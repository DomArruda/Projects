This app uses Natural Lanaguage Processing/AI to automate the generation of
Anki Flashcards. Currently there are two ways to use it: either by directly pasting
text, or by uploading a PDF. Future plans involves using AI to summarize text and better
identifying the optimal words to "mask" in each question. Options such as scraping
websites, word documents, and videos will also be included.
